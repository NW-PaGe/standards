This should be the first thing you do before running/writing any code.\ngit status will tell you:\n\nWhich branch you are in\nIf your local branch is up to date when comparing to that branch in the remote repo\nIf you have any files waiting to be committed\n\ngit fetch will:\n\nRefresh your branch\nSearch for any differences between your local clone and the repo in github. If there are changes, it will display a message\n\ngit pull will pull all the changes in the remote repo into your local clone branch\n \n\ngit status\n\nError in running command C:/Users/FAA3303/new_git/Git/bin/bash.exe\n\n\n \n\ngit fetch\n\nError in running command C:/Users/FAA3303/new_git/Git/bin/bash.exe\n\n\n \n\ngit pull\n\nError in running command C:/Users/FAA3303/new_git/Git/bin/bash.exe\n\n\nIt’s the same in the git desktop app. Make sure you are in the branch you want to be in, then click fetch and pull to update that branch to include the most recent commits in the remote repo\n\n\n\nSwitch to feature branch\nIf we want to make changes to code, first make a new branch off the main.\ngit branch will show all the branches in the repo and the one you are currently in\ngit checkout -b new-branch-name will create a new branch. In this case, we already have our feature branch called test-dcipher-cases\ngit checkout branch-name will switch to a branch. In this case we can switch to test-dcipher-cases\n\ngit branch\n\nError in running command C:/Users/FAA3303/new_git/Git/bin/bash.exe\n\n\n\ngit checkout test-dcipher-cases\n\nOr in the desktop app\n\n\n\nMaking changes\nIf we want to make a change to the code, make a new branch off of test-dcipher-cases and switch to that branch\n\n\ngit checkout -b test-frank2\n\n\nand in the desktop app:\n\n\n\n\nCommitting changes to the feature branch\nNow you can make changes in your R script and when you save them they will be ready to be committed to this new branch.\ngit add to stage your changes\ngit commit -am \"messge\" to commit those changes to the new branch with a message\ngit push --set-upstream origin test-dcipher-cases to push those changes to the remote repo on the new branch\n\ngit add\n\ngit commit -am \"this is a test- pls delete\"\n\ngit push --set-upstream origin test-dcipher-cases\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking a pull request\nThis part happens in github.\n\nSelect who you want to review your code and assign yourself.\nUse labels to tag what this pull request refers to (very helpful in search for changes when managing the project) and\nAdd a milestone if it applies.\n\nThis should automatically send an email to the reviewers that there is code needed to be merged to a branch.\n\n\n\nFor Reviewers\nWhen reviewing changes, make sure the commit/changes are being merged to the correct branch.\nGithub automatically compares to the main branch, so you will have to manually click on the base branch and change it to test-dcipher-cases",

Two commonly used templates are issue templates and discussion templates.\nIn the public repos there may be end users that may have limited experience using Github. If they want to submit an issue or ask a question they get lost. Templates can help them form a question or idea. Templates can also help standardize how issues and discussions are maintained throughout the organization.\nStructuring the format of issues and discussions can make the author and the end-user’s lives easier.\nIn the .github repo I made a folder called .github. This is a special folder that can hold Github Action workflows and more, as mentioned above.\nIn the .github folder I have a folder called DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE and another called ISSUE_TEMPLATE.

We can require a pull request to the branch before merging to ensure that all commits are reviewed before being added to the main code base. Follow the steps below to protect your branch.\n\n1. Protecting the main Branch\n\nStep 1.1: Enable Branch Protection Rules\nOn your GitHub repository website page:\n\nNavigate to Settings &gt; Branches &gt; Branch Protection Rules in the repository.\nClick Add branch ruleset.\nEnter a name for your ruleset.\nChange Enforcement status: Active\nUnder Targets, click Add target:\n\nEither click Include by pattern and type in main or if main is your default branch click Include default branch.\n\nUnder Rules:\n\nRequire a pull request before merging.\nRestrict deletions.\nBlock force pushes.\nRequire status checks to pass before merging (optional but recommended for repos with CI/CD checks).\nUnder Require a pull request before merging: Enable Require approvals and specify the number of reviewers (optional)\n\nSave changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. GitHub App to allow bypass\nNow that the main branch is protected and requires a pull request, our GitHub Actions will not be able to push code automatically because they cannot push to the main branch. You can have the Action make a pull request, but often we want our GitHub Actions to just automatically push code on a cadence or trigger. We need a bot to be able to bypass the branch protections for this because GitHub refuses to make this an easy option.\n\nStep 2.1 create an app\nGo to your Org Settings &gt; scroll all the way down to Developer Settings &gt; Click GitHub Apps &gt; New GitHub App\n\n\nStep 2.2 generate secret\nGenerate a client secret for the app. This will save a .pem file for the app to your local machine. SAVE THIS in a SECURE PLACE!!\n\n\nStep 2.3 install the app\nGo to Install App on the left toolbar &gt; under Repository Access click All repositories &gt; then save and Install\n\n\nStep 2.4 store secrets (for admins)\nGo to your Org main page &gt; settings &gt; Secrets and variables &gt; New organization secret\nWe’re going to make two secrets:\n\nYOUR_GITHUB_APP_ID - you can find this id when clicking on your app under App ID:, it should be like 110103202\nYOUR_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY - this is in the .pem file that you downloaded above. Copy everything including -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----. Then paste that into the secret\n\nYou won’t be able to see these secrets again but you can overwrite them if needed.\n\n\nStep 2.5 (for all users) allow branch protection bypass\nGo to Settings &gt; Branches &gt; select your main branch protection (click Edit) &gt; make sure ‘Require a pull request before merging’ is selected &gt; below it, check the option called ‘Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests’ &gt; add nwpage-let-me-in\n\n\n\nStep 2.6 set up a github action\nNow we need to use the github app in our github action. Add this step to you GitHub Action workflow:\nsteps:\n  # Step 1: Create GitHub App Token\n  - name: Create GitHub App Token\n    id: app-token\n    uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1\n    with:\n      app-id: ${{ secrets.YOUR_GITHUB_APP_ID }}\n      private-key: ${{ secrets.YOUR_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}\n\n  # Step 2: Checkout repository code using GitHub App Token\n  - name: Check out repository code\n    uses: actions/checkout@v4\n    with:\n      token: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}\n  - run: echo \"💡 The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nI had tons of problems with the github action making infinite loops and triggering over and over on push to main.

    "text": "Protect Credentials with .gitignore\nIt is bad practice and a security risk to add private credentials to a script. If your script contains things like passwords, server names, or network drives, be aware that that information will be publicly visible when you push it to a remote git/github repo. Many of our scripts must call passwords and server names in order for them to work properly, so we need a way to hide that information from the public but still be able to run the scripts locally. .gitignore can help achieve this.\nIn the root of your repo there should be a file called .gitignore. This files contains a list of file types that we don’t want to be added to the remote git repo. Here’s an example:\nconsider this .gitignore:\n\n\n\n\n.gitignore\n\n# excel files\n*.xlsx\n*.xls\n\n# logs\n*.log\n\n# text files\n*.txt\n\n# RDS Objects\n*.RDS\n\n\n\nIt contains anything with an excel, log, txt or RDS extension. This means that any file with those extensions that you create in your local clone of the repo will exist for you, but the file cannot and will not ever be pushed to the remote repo.\n\nEnvironment Variables + .gitignore\nWe can store private information in local files and make sure that the do not get pushed to the public remote repo by using .gitignore. There are a number of ways to do this. We typically use a yaml file that can be filled out with personal credentials locally. The file will not be committed to the remote repo.\nThere are many ways to achieve this. If you have a more simple workflow that uses R, consider the .Renviron approach. If you have a more complex workflow that has multiple languages and many credentials, consider the yaml approach\n\n.Renvironyaml\n\n\nIf you’re using just R in your repo and have just a few things you want private, consider using a .Renviron file in addition to .gitignore.\n\nIn the .gitignore, add .Renviron:\n\n\n\n\n.gitignore\n\n# R Environment Variables\n.Renviron\n\n\n\nCreate a .Renviron file at the root of you local repo\nAdd the things you want to be kept private\n\n\n\n\n.Renviron\n\nmy_password=\"thisismypassword123\"\n\n\n\nNow in an R script you can call that password and hide the credentials instead of writting the password in the script for everyone to see:\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngood_script.R\n\nmy_password &lt;- Sys.getenv('my_password')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbad_script.R\n\nmy_password &lt;- \"thisismypassword123\"\n\n\n\n\nSys.getenv() looks for the .Renviron file and the variables inside of it. This means you can get all your credentials from the .Renviron but also keep that information\n\n\nHere’s another way to add credentials that may be more robust.\nMany of our scripts use a .yml file that contains a list of API tokens, server names, and usernames/passwords specific to each individual user. There are two .yml files. One is a template (containing no actual passwords..) that exists in the repo and serves as a template so every individual user can keep up to date with new credential additions. The other is the individual creds.yml that is in the repo’s .gitignore. This file will never exist in the repo and only exist locally (in the user’s C drive).\nThe .yml file can work with multiple programming languages including R and Python. They are read in the same way and can be easily adjusted when adding new passwords or using them as configuration files. It can work like this:\n\nIn your .gitignore, add a new line that says creds.yml.\n\n\n\n\n\n.gitignore\n\n# creds files\ncreds.yml\n\n\n\n\nIn the root of you local git clone, make a file called creds.yml.\nIn the yaml file you can nest values. For example, under conn_list_wdrs I have all the parameters needed to make a SQL server connection string in R/Python:\n\n\n\n\ncreds.yml\n\n# Default is needed to distinguish values.\n# Leave a blank line (NO SPACES) as the last line in this file or things will break\n# Quotes aren't necessary, but can be used.\ndefault: \n  conn_list_wdrs:\n    Driver: \"SQL Server Native Client 11.0\"\n    Server: \"someservername\"\n    Database: \"db\"\n    Trusted_connection: \"yes\" \n    ApplicationIntent: \"readonly\"\n    \n  fulgent:\n    username: &lt;USERNAME&gt;\n    password: &lt;PASSWORD&gt;\n\n\n\nTo call these credentials in R or Python it will look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscript.R\n\nlibrary(yaml)\n\n# read in the local credentials yaml file\ncreds &lt;- yaml::read_yaml(\"creds.yml\")$default\n\n# call in the variables\n\nconnection &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(\n  odbc::odbc(), \n  Driver = creds$conn_list_wdrs$Driver, \n  Server = creds$conn_list_wdrs$Server, \n  Database = creds$conn_list_wdrs$Database, \n  Trusted_connection = creds$conn_list_wdrs$Trusted_connection, \n  ApplicationIntent = creds$conn_list_wdrs$ApplicationIntent\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscript.py\n\nimport yaml\n\n# read credentials\nwith open(f\"creds.yml\") as f:\n    creds = yaml.safe_load(f)['default']\n\nconn = pyodbc.connect(\n  DRIVER=creds['conn_list_wdrs']['Driver'],\n  SERVER=creds['conn_list_wdrs']['Server'],\n  DATABASE=creds['conn_list_wdrs']['Database'],\n  Trusted_Connection=creds['conn_list_wdrs']['Trusted_connection'],\n  ApplicationIntent=creds['conn_list_wdrs']['ApplicationIntent']\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add more nested sections besides default, like this, where I added a test parameter:\n\n\n\n\ncreds.yml\n\n# Default is needed to distinguish values.\n# Leave a blank line (NO SPACES) as the last line in this file or things will break\n# Quotes aren't necessary, but can be used.\ndefault: \n  conn_list_wdrs:\n    Driver: \"SQL Server Native Client 11.0\"\n    Server: \"someservername\"\n    Database: \"db\"\n    Trusted_connection: \"yes\" \n    ApplicationIntent: \"readonly\"\n    \n  fulgent:\n    username: &lt;USERNAME&gt;\n    password: &lt;PASSWORD&gt;\n\ntest:\n  conn_list_wdrs:\n    Driver: \"SQL Server Native Client 11.0\"\n    Server: \n    Database: \n    Trusted_connection: \n    ApplicationIntent: \n\n\nThis is useful to organized and automatically call different parameters. Now there is a test list with its own variables. This lets us switch a set of variables within our scripts. default applies to the main credentials where test can distinguish which variables should be test or dev scripts specific. Notice below that you can now call the credentials from a .yml file into an R or Python script and the actual credentials will never exist in the code pushed to the repo.\n\n\n\nscript-in-repo.R\n\n# this script is in the repo, but credentials are hidden\nlibrary(yaml)\n\n# read in the local credentials yaml file\ncreds &lt;- yaml::read_yaml(\"path/to/local-credentials.yml\")\n\n# pull in the credentials\nserver_name &lt;- creds$default$conn_list_wdrs$server\n\n\n\nAutomating With Yaml Creds\nWe can even get more specific and add an if-else statement to specify which credential we want to select. This can be helpful if we have a CI/CD pipeline and have a script automatically run on a task scheduler or cron job. We can call the credentials we want in the command line and have the command line code run in my task scheduler. That way we can use multiple different versions of the same script and have all of it be automated.\nFor example,\n\nthe R script on the left uses the commandArgs() to pull any arguments passed to the script in a shell/command line script.\non the right, the shell script has production and test as second arguments.\nthese are passed to the R script as arg[2].\nnow we can use arg[2] in the if-else statement to conditionally select credentials and do it automatically in a pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscript-in-repo.R\n\nargs &lt;- commandArgs(TRUE)\n\n# this script is in the repo, but credentials are hidden\nlibrary(yaml)\n\n# read in the local credentials yaml file\ncreds &lt;- yaml::read_yaml(\"path/to/local-credentials.yml\")\n\n# pull in the credentials\nif(args[2] == \"production\"){\n  server_name &lt;- creds$default$conn_list_wdrs$server\n} else if(args[2] == \"test\"){\n  server_name &lt;- creds$test$conn_list_wdrs$server\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshell-trigger-script.sh\n\n# Run the production code\n$ Rscript -e \"source('path/script_in_repo.R');\" production\n\n# Run the test/dev code\n$ Rscript -e \"source('path/script_in_repo.R');\" test \n\n\n\n\n\n\nyaml Template\nYou can put a template creds.yml file in your repo so that others can see what credentials they need in order for the code to run.\nThis is a template file, so it will not have any passwords/secrets in it. Its only purpose is to provide an example copy of what a user’s creds.yml file needs to look like.\n\nMake a template called creds_TEMPLATE.yml\nRemove any passwords, usernames, secrets, etc to have it be a file that looks like this:\n\n\n\n\ncreds_TEMPLATE.yml\n\n# Default is needed to distinguish values.\n# Leave a blank line (NO SPACES) as the last line in this file or things will break\n# Quotes aren't necessary, but can be used.\ndefault: \n  conn_list_wdrs:\n    Driver: \n    Server: \n    Database: \n    Trusted_connection: \n    ApplicationIntent: \n    \n  fulgent:\n    username: \n    password: \n\ntest:\n  conn_list_wdrs:\n    Driver: \n    Server: \n    Database: \n    Trusted_connection: \n    ApplicationIntent: \n\n\n\nOnce you have the creds_TEMPLATE.yml template in your repo, make sure that nobody on your team (or anyone with write access..) is able to accidentally push changes to the template. We don’t want someone’s passwords or API tokens to exist in GitHub.\n\nThis link shows how to skip any changes made to the specific file https://stackoverflow.com/a/39776107. If someone makes local changes to the template, the changes will not show in their commit. It is a safe guard.\n\nFor all individual users, run this code:\n\n\n\n\nPowerShell\n\ngit update-index --skip-worktree creds_TEMPLATE.yml\n\n\n\n\nThis will tell your local git to ignore any changes made to creds_TEMPLATE.yml, but also allow it to exist in the repo (since .gitignore will prevent it from being in the repo)\n\nIf you need to update the template file run this:\n\n\n\n\nPowerShell\n\ngit update-index --no-skip-worktree creds_TEMPLATE.yml\n\n\n\n\nThis will allow changes to the template. So when you need to update the template, use this code\nAnd to get a list of files that are “skipped”, use this code:\n\n\n\n\nPowerShell\n\ngit ls-files -v . | grep ^S",

If you are pushing a pre-existing repo to a public repo for the first time, you should scan the existing code in the repo because the pre-commit hook will not automatically do that. They are really set up to prevent any future secrets from being pushed to the repo, not to scan what is currently in the repo.\nThere are a few ways to scan the history of your repo for secrets. The git secrets command comes with a few options to scan the history, but I have found that it is a bit broken.\n\nthe git secrets --scan-history command will run forever if you have a large repo (especially if you have html files in it)\nglobs have not worked for me (specifying the file types you want to scan for git secrets --scan *glob)\nlikewise, scanning specific folders have not worked for me like this git secrets --scan directory/*\n\nI’ll show 2 ways to scan for secrets, one with a native git command git log, and the other with git secrets\n\ngit log for scanning\nThis is the easier way to scan commit history.\nNavigate to your repo and execute this command:\n\n\ngit log -G\"&lt;regex here&gt;\" -p\n\n\nNote that the regex pattern can be imported from the secrets_key file. You can also search for simple strings like this\n\n\ngit log -S \"&lt;string&gt;\" -p\n\n\nThere are a lot of options with the git log command and you can read more here and here\nBasically, the -G option stands for grep, -p will show the diffs of the files, and -S is for string.\n\n\ngit secrets for scanning\nThis isn’t my favorite way to scan code, but it is an option if you want to double check things.\n\nCheck that the secrets_key regex is working by running the process on a repo that you know has secrets in it. For example, in a different folder, run all the pre-commit hook steps above and add a known “bad” string into the regex. For example, in the regex put bad_string and in a file in that folder put bad_string. When you scan it should get flagged.\nIf secret scanning is taking too long, you might want to check certain files first. I’ve found that HTML files take a very long time to scan for secrets.\n\nFollow the instructions below to scan for specific files. The script will scan for all the file types that you select.

For example, one conventional naming method is to label any commit associated with a new feature as feat: plus a commit message.\n\nThe word feat: can trigger a Github Action to add that commit to your changelog under the Features header,\nand it will up-version the minor release version number.\nSo if you are on release 1.0.0, a new feat will up-version the cycle to 1.1.0\nCommit titles that start with the word fix: as in a bug fix will up-version the patch number of the, i.e. 1.0.0 to 1.0.1",

    "text": "Automating The Release Cycle\nYou should consider automating your release cycle so that your project cycle is consistent and predictable. There are many different ways to approach this.\nSome repos have semi-automatic cycles where there is some manual component of releasing their software, whereas others are fully automated. Manual releases can work too for some scenarios.\n\nGithub Action for auto releases\nI recommend first creating a test repo for this. In the repo, create a Github Action workflow called changelog.yml. You can copy the full file below:\n\n\n\n.github/workflows/changelog.yml\n\nname: Changelog\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  changelog:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    \n    permissions:\n      # write permission is required to create a github release\n      contents: write\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Conventional Changelog Action\n        id: changelog\n        uses: TriPSs/conventional-changelog-action@v3\n        with:\n          github-token: ${{ secrets.github_token }}\n          create-summary: true\n\n      - name: Create Release\n        uses: actions/create-release@v1\n        if: ${{ steps.changelog.outputs.skipped == 'false' }}\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.github_token }}\n        with:\n          prerelease: false\n          tag_name: ${{ steps.changelog.outputs.tag }}\n          release_name: ${{ steps.changelog.outputs.tag }}\n          body: ${{ steps.changelog.outputs.clean_changelog }}",

If I used conventional commit messages in the title (i.e. feat: message, fix: message) the Github Action workflow will detect the trigger word in the title and divide the commit accordingly in the changelog. Notice how the commit title message gets output automatically into the changelog under the header Bug Fixes and the commit + commit hash number are generated.\nA new version will be released, and since this was just a bug fix the version number went from v2.1.4 to v2.1.5 since bug fixes only up-version the patch numbers",

Step 5 has instructions on how to make sure everyone on your team writes conventional commits. It uses a pre-commit hook, which will prevent any commit that does not have a conventional commit message from being pushed to the repo.\nFor example, this commit message will error out and not be pushed to the repo - this commit is a feature. But this commit message will work - feat: this commit is a feature\n\n(Optional, but recommended) Make a pre-commit hook\n\nOpen a Windows Command Prompt\nInstall pre-commit with the code below\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand Prompt\n\npip install pre-commit\n\n\n\n\nCheck that pre-commit is working by running the code below. If you get an error message with this you may need to install pip\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand Prompt\n\npre-commit --version\n\n\n\n\nIn the root of you repo, make a file called .pre-commit-config.yaml and put the following code in it (note the . is necessary in the file name):\n\n\n\n\n\n.pre-commit-config.yaml\n\nrepos:\n- repo: https://github.com/compilerla/conventional-pre-commit\n  rev: v2.4.0\n  hooks:\n    - id: conventional-pre-commit\n      stages: [commit-msg]\n      args: []\n  # args is optional: list of Conventional Commits types to allow e.g. [feat, fix, ci, chore, test]\n\n\n\n\nLast, in the Windows Command Prompt, run this:\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand Prompt\n\npre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg\n\n\n\n\nNow you will be required to use conventional commit messages when pushing new code to the repo.\nHere’s a common guide:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconventional commit keyword\nexpected outcome\n\n\n\n\nfeat:\nnew changelog, bump up the minor release version (i.e, 1.0.0 to 1.1.0)\n\n\nfix:\nnew changelog, bump up the patch release version (i.e, 1.0.0 to 1.0.1)\n\n\nchore:\ndocs:\ntest:\nno changes\n\n\nany keyword plus BREAKING CHANGE: in the commit message\nnew changelog, bump up the MAJOR release version (i.e, 1.0.0 to 2.0.0)\n\n\n\nNOTE: breaking changes need to be written like this:",

Install GitHub Desktop\nGitHub Desktop is free and can be installed on your Windows or Mac machines. Follow the installation instructions here.\n\n\n1. Protecting the main Branch\n\nStep 1.1: Enable Branch Protection Rules\nOn your GitHub repository website page:\n\nNavigate to Settings &gt; Branches &gt; Branch Protection Rules in the repository.\nClick Add branch ruleset.\nEnter a name for your ruleset.\nChange Enforcement status: Active\nUnder Targets, click Add target:\n\nEither click Include by pattern and type in main or if main is your default branch click Include default branch.\n\nUnder Rules:\n\nRequire a pull request before merging.\nRestrict deletions.\nBlock force pushes.\nRequire status checks to pass before merging (optional but recommended for repos with CI/CD checks).\nUnder Require a pull request before merging: Enable Require approvals and specify the number of reviewers (optional)\n\nSave changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Initial SetUp: Cloning the Repository\n\nOpen GitHub Desktop\n\nOpening up GitHub Desktop should bring you to a UI similar to this where you see tabs for Current repository and Current branch. \n\nClick the drop down arrow for Current repository &gt; Add &gt; Clone repository or you can click File &gt; Clone Repository \nIn the dialog box:\n\nSearch for the repository that you want to clone\nSelect the location you would like to clone the repository to on your local machine\n\nClick Clone\n\nNote: If you don’t have collaborator access to a repository you will not be able to clone the repository.\n The repo and its contents will be located at the local path you’ve selected.\n\n\n3. Creating a Branch\n\nEnsure the main branch is selected in the current repository\n\nif not, click the branch dropdown in the top bar and select main\n\nMake sure that main is up to date by clicking Fetch origin\nClick Branch &gt; New Branch\nEnter a descriptive name for the branch, such as feature/add-readme or bugfix/fix-typo.\nEnsure that it says “Your new branch will be based on your currently checked out branch (main). main is the default branch for your repository”, then click Create Branch.\nThe new branch will now be checked out automatically.\n\n ###\n\nMake changes and commit those changes to the branch\nMake changes to the files and code in your repository folder\nAfter making changes:\n\nGo back to GitHub Desktop\nYou’ll see the list of changed files under the Changes tab\n\nStage and commit your changes:\n\nWrite a short, descriptive commit message in the Summary field (e.g. docs: added details to README)\nOptionally, add a description for more details\nClick Commit to &lt;branch_name&gt; to save your changes locally\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Keeping Your Branch Up-to-Date\nTo avoid conflicts, ensure your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from main\n\nSwitch to the main branch\n\nClick the branch drop down and select main\nClick Fetch origin to pull the latest changes\n\nSwitch back to your branch and merge main\n\nClick Current branch &gt; Choose a branch to merge into  or you can click at the top Branch &gt; Merge into Current Branch\nSelect main as the branch to merge.\nIf the branch is up to date with main then the “Create a merge commit” button will not be clickable.\nCreate a merge commit if there are differences between main and your branch.\n\nResolve any conflicts (if prompted).\nMake any necessary commits after resolving conflicts\n\n\n\n\n6. Pushing Changes to GitHub\n\nAfter committing your changes, click Publish branch in GitHub Desktop to push the new branch to GitHub\nIf the branch is already published, click Push origin to sync your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.\n\n\n\n7. Create a Pull Request\n\nOpen GitHub Desktop and click Branch &gt; Create Pull Request\n\nThis opens the pull request (PR) page on GitHub in your web browser\n\nFill out the PR form:\n\nEnsure the source branch is your feature branch and the target branch is main at the top of the PR where it should say base:main &lt;- compare:&lt;branch_name&gt;\nIf your repository is in the NW-PaGe organization we have auto-populated Pull Request Templates to remind you to look for sensitive data that may be accidentally included in your commits or the pull request itself.\n\nSubmit the pull request\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Reviewing and Addressing Feedback\n\nCollaborators may review your pull request and suggest changes.\nIf changes are requested:\n\nMake updates locally in your branch\nCommit the changes in GitHub Desktop\nPush the branch to update the PR automatically\n\n\n\n\n9.

Branching Workflow\n\nStep 3.1: Create a branch\nBranches are created to isolate development tasks. Always branch off the main branch.\n\nPull the latest change from the main branch:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit checkout main \ngit pull origin main \n\n\n\n\nCreate and switch to a new branch\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt; \n\n\n\nNote: Branches can be called whatever you’d like. If you’d like to organize your name conventions you could consider using prefixes like feature/,bugfix/. This would look like: git checkout -b feature/add-flu-lbis\n\nPush the new branch to publish on GitHub:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit push -u origin &lt;branch_name&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3.2: Develop on the branch\n\nMake changes to the code/repository.\nStage the changes:\n\nFirst check that you have the changes you want to make by running git status. This will show all the files you’ve changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit status\n\n\n\n\nThen when you’re sure you have the changes you want, you can stage the changes individually or all at once:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit add &lt;path/to/changed/file&gt; # stage individual file (conservative and secure approach)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit add . # stage all files at once (risky approach)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\ngit add . will stage all files with changes or deletions. This could be a security risk if you’re unaware of all the changes you’ve made on a branch.\n\n\n\nCommit the changes with a descriptive message:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit commit -m \"docs: make changes to readme documentation to include instructions on logging in\"\n\n\n\nNote: Use clear, description messages. You can follow the format of conventional commits such as &lt;type&gt;:&lt;subject&gt; for a commit message. Example: fix: fix bug in merge.py script.\nPlease see the Release Cycle page for more info. In summary, conventional commits can trigger an action in GitHub. For example, whenever a commit title contains the word fix: , a GitHub Action will bump up the codebase’s version number from something like 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 - We use the following key words in our commit messages:\n\n\n\nkey word\nwhen to use it\n\n\n\n\nfix:\na commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).\n\n\nfeat:\na commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).\n\n\ndocs:\nyour commit is related to updating the documentation and not the codebase itself\n\n\nchore:\nyour commit doesn’t change what the code or documentation does, it just updates something like formatting, file structure, naming conventions, etc.\n\n\ntest:\nyour commit is just a test commit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Making Pull Requests (PRs)\n\nStep 4.1 Update your Branch with main\nBefore opening a PR, ensure your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes in main to ensure compatability. 1. Swith to the main branch and pull the latest changes:\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit checkout main \ngit pull origin main \n\n\n\n\nSwitch back to your branch:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit checkout &lt;branch_name&gt; \n\n\n\n\nMerge main into your branch\n-   Merge (safe and retains all commit history):\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit merge main\n\n\n\nNote: if you’re comfortable with git and you need to keep a clean git history, consider using git rebase main. Here’s an excellent article explaining the pros and cons of merge vs rebase\n\nResolve conflicts, if any:\n-   Edit conflicting files, then stage the changes:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit add &lt;file_name&gt; \n\n\n\n    -   Commit the resolved conflicts:\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit commit -m \"chore: Resolve merge conflicts with main\" \n\n\n\n\nPush the updated branch:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit push \n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4.2: Open a Pull Request\n\nPush changes to the feature branch:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit push origin &lt;branch_name&gt; \n\n\n\n\nOn GitHub, click Pull Requests &gt; New Pull Request.\nSelect your branch as the source and main as the target.\nAdd a title and descripton, request reviews, and submit\nSubmit the pull request.\n\n\n\nStep 4.2: Resolve any Pull Request Feedback\n\nAddress feedback in your branch then commit and push back to the branch\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit add . \ngit commit -m \"Address PR feedback\" \ngit push \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Merging Pull Requests\n\nStep 5.1: Merge into main\n\nEnsure the PR passes all checks and is approved.\nClick Merge Pull Request\nDelete the branch on GitHub by clicking Delete Branch\n\n\n\n\n6. Pruning Branches\n\nStep 6.1: Delete Local Branches\n\nList all local branches\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit branch \n\n\n\n\nDelete a branch:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit branch -d &lt;branch_name&gt; \n\n\n\nNote: Use -D to force delete if the branch isn’t merged\n\n\n\n7. Update main with the merged PR\nAfter merging your pull request, it’s important to update your local main branch to reflect the latest changes from the remote repository. 1. Switch to the main branch:\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit checkout main \n\n\n\n\nPull the latest changes from the remote:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit pull origin main",

    "section": "Cloning a Repo",
    "text": "Cloning a Repo\nWhether you have created your own repo or want to contribute to someone else’s repo, you will need to make a local clone of that repo on your personal machine.\nTo make a local clone of a repo, click on the green Code button when you’re in the main repo’s web page. In the local tab there are multiple ways to clone. For most of our work, I suggest creating an SSH key. If you are new to git/Github and on a Windows machine, I recommend installing the Github Desktop app and following the instructions below.\n\nHTTPSSSHGitHub CLIOpen with GitHub Desktop\n\n\nCloning via HTTPS is a relatively quick process.\n\nStart by navigating to the repo in Github and selecting the Code button:\n\n\n\nCopy the path that starts with https://, in this case it’s https://github.com/NW-PaGe/standards.git\nIn a terminal/command prompt, navigate to a folder of your choice (in windows I would make a folder called Projects here: C:/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Projects)\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ncd C:/Users/&lt;your_username&gt;/Projects\n\n\n\n\nUse git clone and replace the https://github.com/NW-PaGe/standards.git with your path:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit clone https://github.com/NW-PaGe/standards.git\n\n\n\n\nCheck if things ran by executing this code:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit status\n\n\n\nNOTE: the HTTPS method is good but it will require you to enter your username and a token every time you push a commit to the remote repo in Github. You will need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) whenever you want to make a commit. If this is annoying to you, use the SSH or Github Desktop App methods.\n\nMake a PAT\nHere’s a guide on making a PAT\n\nClick on you Github profile icon in the upper right\nClick Settings\nScroll down to Developer Settings\nSelect Personal access tokens (classic) and then Generate new token\nWhen you make a commit you will need to input this personal access token when it asks for your password.\n\nDo not store this token anywhere! Especially make sure it is not stored in your repo. This has tons of security risks and needs to be for singular use only\n\n\n\nSSH is an excellent option for cloning a repo. It is similar to using an identifier to tell Github that you are, in fact, you. This video below is a great resource on how to set up the key. I will also write out the steps in the video below. Also, see the Github documentation for more information.\n\n\nIn a terminal, write the following and replace the email with your email:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C your@email.com\n\n\n\n\nIt should then ask if you want to make a passphrase. I recommend doing this\nGet the pid\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n\n\n\n\nMake a config file\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ntouch ~/.ssh/config\n\n\n\n\nIf the file doesn’t open, you can open it like this\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\nnano ~/.ssh/config\n\n\n\n\nAdd this to the config file. it will use your passkey and recognize you\n\n\n\n\n\nssh/config\n\nHost *\n  IgnoreUnknown AddKeysToAgent,UseKeychain\n  AddKeysToAgent yes\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n  UseKeychain yes\n\n\n\nTo save this file in nano, on your keyboard write CRTL+O then ENTER to save the file. Then CTRL+X to exit back to the terminal. You can also open this file through a notepad or other software. You could also search for the file in your file explorer and edit it in notepad if that is easier.\n\nAdd the identity\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n\n\n\n\nIn Github, go to your profile and the SSH + GPG Keys section\nClick SSH Keys, add a title, and in the key location write your key. You can find your key in your terminal by writing:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n\n\n\nCopy the whole output including your email and paste it into the Github key location\n\nTest it by writing this:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\nssh -T git@github.com\n\n\n\n\nUse the key to clone a repo.\n\nNow you can clone a repo using the SSH key. Copy the SSH path and write this (replace the string after clone with your repo of choice):\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngit clone git@github.com:org/reponame.git\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GitHub CLI is an excellent tool for not just cloning your repo, but for managing repositories and organizations from a terminal.\n\nWindowsWSL/Linux\n\n\nTo install the CLI in Windos, I follwed the instructions provided in the Github CLI repo.\nI normally install commands using Scoop, but you have many options here.\n\nPaste this code into a powershell window and execute it\n\n\n\n\n\npowershell\n\nwinget install --id GitHub.cli\n\n\n\n\nNow update the package\n\n\n\nwinget upgrade --id GitHub.cli\n\n\n\nYou will need to authorize your github account like this:\n\n\n\ngh auth login\n\n\n\nIt will ask you to authorize in a browser or with a personal access token\n\nI created a personal access token.\n\nNow you can clone a repo like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngh repo clone org/repo-name\n\n\n\nYou can also now do some cool things with your org/repo like searching for strings, creating issues, and more. For example, here are the issues in this repo:\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngh issue list\n\n\n\n\n\n\noutput\n\nShowing 3 of 3 open issues in NW-PaGe/standards\n\nID  TITLE                                      LABELS         UPDATED           \n#7  add .gitignore documentation                              about 2 months ago\n#3  Make sure all references are added to ...  documentation  about 5 months ago\n#2  Fix cross reference links                  documentation  about 5 months ago\n\n\n\n\nTo install in a linux terminal, I’m following the instructions provided in the Github CLI repo.\n\nPaste this code into your bash terminal and execute it.\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\n(type -p wget &gt;/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install wget -y)) \\\n&& sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings \\\n&& wget -qO- https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg &gt; /dev/null \\\n&& sudo chmod go+r /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \\\n&& echo \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list &gt; /dev/null \\\n&& sudo apt update \\\n&& sudo apt install gh -y\n\n\n\nThen upgrate the command with the code below\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install gh\n\n\n\n\nYou now need to authorize yourself as a user.\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngh auth login\n\n\n\n\nIt will ask you to authorize in a browser or with a personal access token\n\nI created a personal access token. In linux there are some issues with the command and using a browser fyi.\n\nNow you can clone a repo like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngh repo clone org/repo-name\n\n\n\nYou can also now do some cool things with your org/repo like searching for strings, creating issues, and more. For example, here are the issues in this repo:\n\n\n\n\nterminal\n\ngh issue list\n\n\n\n\n\n\noutput\n\nShowing 3 of 3 open issues in NW-PaGe/standards\n\nID  TITLE                                      LABELS         UPDATED           \n#7  add .gitignore documentation                              about 2 months ago\n#3  Make sure all references are added to ...  documentation  about 5 months ago\n#2  Fix cross reference links                  documentation  about 5 months ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re new to Git or Github and are using a Windows machine, the GitHub Desktop app is a great option for managing git workflows.\n\nInstall the app\nYou will need to authenticate your account\nNow you should be able to clone repos through the app. In Github, when you click on the Code tab you will see the option to open in Github Desktop:\n\n\nThis will open up the desktop app and let you choose a file path for your Github repos. I recommend putting your repos into a Github or Projects folder in your local C drive, like this\n\nC:/Users/yourname/Projects/&lt;your-repo&gt;/\n\nIf you’re cloning many repos you should put the repos into folders separated by the Github org\n\nC:/Users/yourname/Projects/&lt;gh-org-name&gt;/&lt;repo-in-org&gt;/",

Making a container can be a little tricky, so we’ve made Github templates that have devcontainers already made. See templates. There are R, Python, and general default templates. These containers will install R, Rstudio, Python, and all the packages in the repo’s virtual environments (venv, conda, pip, renv, etc) so that the user can run all the code in your repo within a couple minutes.\nTo set up a devcontainer for yourself;\n\nClick on `Code &gt; Codespaces &gt; Configure dev container\n\n\n\nThis will make a folder named .devcontainer at the root of your repo\nIn that folder it will make a file named devcontainer.json\nOn the right there is a searchable marketplace for software to add to your container\n\n\n\nEach one comes with instructions on how to add the software to the .devcontainer.json\n\nFor more information about Codespaces, see the guides here",
