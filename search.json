    "section": "Prevent Credential Leaks with Env Variables",
    "text": "Prevent Credential Leaks with Env Variables\nThere are a number of ways to do this. We typically use a yaml file that can be filled out with personal credentials locally. The file will not be committed to the remote repo\n\n0.0.1 Create a private credentials file\nThe scripts use a .yml file that contains a list of API tokens, server names, and usernames/passwords specific to each individual user. There are two .yml files. One is a template (containing no actual passwords..) that exists in the repo and serves as a template so every individual user can keep up to date with new credential additions. The other is the individual creds.yml that is in the repo’s .gitignore. This file will never exist in the repo and only exist locally (in the user’s C drive).\n\n\n0.0.2 creds.yml details\nThe .yml file can work with multiple programming languages including R and Python. They are read in the same way and can be easily adjusted when adding new passwords or using them as configuration files.\nThey look like this:\n\n\n\n\nlocal-credentials.yml\n\n# Default is needed to distinguish values.\n# Leave a blank line (NO SPACES) as the last line in this file or things will break\n# Quotes aren't necessary, but can be used.\ndefault: \n  conn_list_wdrs:\n    Driver: \"SQL Server Native Client 11.0\"\n    Server: \n    Database: \n    Trusted_connection: \n    ApplicationIntent: \n    \n  fulgent:\n    username: &lt;USERNAME&gt;\n    password: &lt;PASSWORD&gt;\n\n\n\nYou can have different variables assigned to unique lists, which allows for easy configuration. For example, the list starting with default has variables conn_list_wdrs and fulgent. You can have a different list of variables within the same file like this:\n\n\n\n\nlocal-credentials.yml\n\n# Default is needed to distinguish values.\n# Leave a blank line (NO SPACES) as the last line in this file or things will break\n# Quotes aren't necessary, but can be used.\ndefault: \n  conn_list_wdrs:\n    Driver: \"SQL Server Native Client 11.0\"\n    Server: \n    Database: \n    Trusted_connection: \n    ApplicationIntent: \n    \n  fulgent:\n    username: &lt;USERNAME&gt;\n    password: &lt;PASSWORD&gt;\n\ntest:\n  conn_list_wdrs:\n    Driver: \"SQL Server Native Client 11.0\"\n    Server: \n    Database: \n    Trusted_connection: \n    ApplicationIntent: \n\n\n\nNow there is a test list with its own variables. This lets us switch a set of variables within our scripts. default applies to the main credentials where test can distinguish which variables should be test or dev scripts specific. Notice below that you can now call the credentials from a .yml file into an R or Python script and the actual credentials will never exist in the code pushed to the repo.\n\n\n\n\nscript-in-repo.R\n\n# this script is in the repo, but credentials are hidden\nlibrary(yaml)\n\n# read in the local credentials yaml file\ncreds &lt;- yaml::read_yaml(\"path/to/local-credentials.yml\")\n\n# pull in the credentials\nserver_name &lt;- creds$default$conn_list_wdrs$server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can even get more specific and add an if-else statement to specify which credential we want to select. This can be helpful if we have a CI/CD pipeline and have a script automatically run on a task scheduler or cron job. We can call the credentials we want in the command line and have the command line code run in my task scheduler. That way we can use multiple different versions of the same script and have all of it be automated. For example, the middle panel uses the commandArgs() to pull any arguments passed to the script in a shell/command line script. In the right panel, the shell script has production and test as second arguments. These are passed to the R script as arg[2]. Now we can use arg[2] in the if-else statement to conditionally select credentials and do it automatically.\n\n\n\n\nscript-in-repo.R\n\nargs &lt;- commandArgs(TRUE)\n\n# this script is in the repo, but credentials are hidden\nlibrary(yaml)\n\n# read in the local credentials yaml file\ncreds &lt;- yaml::read_yaml(\"path/to/local-credentials.yml\")\n\n# pull in the credentials\nif(args[2] == \"production\"){\n  server_name &lt;- creds$default$conn_list_wdrs$server\n} else if(args[2] == \"test\"){\n  server_name &lt;- creds$test$conn_list_wdrs$server\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nshell-trigger-script.sh\n\n# Run the production code\n$ Rscript -e \"source('path/script_in_repo.R');\" production\n\n# Run the test/dev code\n$ Rscript -e \"source('path/script_in_repo.R');\" test \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0.3 Safe Guards - Prevent Accidental Leaks!\nOnce you have the credentials.yml template in your repo, make sure that nobody on your team (or anyone with write access..) is able to accidentally push changes to the template. We don’t want someone’s passwords or API tokens to exist in GitHub.\nThis link shows how to skip any changes made to the specific file. If someone makes local changes to the template, the changes will not show in their commit. It is a safe guard.\n\n0.0.3.1 For all individual users, run this code:\n\n\ngit update-index --skip-worktree creds_TEMPLATE.yml\n\n\nThis will tell your local git to ignore any changes made to creds_TEMPLATE.yml, but also allow it to exist in the repo (since .gitignore will prevent it from being in the repo)\n\n\n0.0.3.2 If you need to update the template file run this:\n\n\ngit update-index --no-skip-worktree creds_TEMPLATE.yml\n\n\nThis will allow changes to the template. So when you need to update the template, use this code\nAnd to get a list of files that are “skipped”, use this code:\n\n\ngit ls-files -v . | grep ^S"

Meaning we can’t use patterns like this in our regex: (?:abc) – see https://regexr.com IMPORTANT: Tab separate your regex expressions. Making new lines caused a bit of chaos and took really long to figure out. (you can use multiple tabs to separate them more visually)\n\n\n\n NOTE!!\n\nThe REGEX strings used in the secrets_key file may be decieving\nMake sure to test that the regex flags what you want it to\ngit secrets --scan-history may take a very long time to run\n\n\n\nCheck that the secrets_key regex is working by running the process on a repo that you know has secrets in it. For example, in a different folder, run all the pre-commit hook steps above and add a known “bad” string into the regex. For example, in the regex put bad_string and in a file in that folder put bad_string. When you scan it should get flagged.\nIf secret scanning is taking too long, you might want to check certain files first. I’ve found that HTML files take a very long time to scan for secrets. If you’re using linux or macOS you should be able to scan certain files via grob like this git secrets --scan path/to/files*. If you’re using windows it probably won’t work. In that case, if you only want certain file extentsions to be scanned, use this function in powershell below. Download the file here:\n\n Download Secret Scanner Script \n\n\n\n\nsecret-scanner9000.ps1\n\n# Example Usage\n# write this in the powershell terminal, adjust for the file type(s) you want to scan - can be multiple types: $fileExtensions = @(\".R\", \".py\")\n# then execute this in the terminal: ScanFiles -FileExtensions $fileExtensions\n\n# It will give you an output of any secrets that are contained in those files\n\nFunction ScanFiles{\n  param (\n      [string]$filePath = (Get-Location).Path,\n      [string[]]$fileExtensions\n) \n  Get-ChildItem $filePath -recurse | Where-Object {$_.extension -in $fileExtensions} | \n  Foreach-Object {\n\n      git secrets --scan $_.FullName | Out-File $logFile -Append\n\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nNow, you can scan your secrets by copying and pasting the code into a powershell terminal like this:\n\n\n\n\nPowerShell\n\n$fileExtensions = @(\".R\",\".py\",\".Rmd\",\".qmd\")\nScanFiles -FileExtensions $fileExtensions"

It is also probably safer and better than the _freeze way, but it requires a better understanding of Github Actions and virtual environments.\nrenv is an R package for creating a project level virtual environment. In other words, renv will create project specific folders that contain the specific R package versions you use in an project. More on this here\nTo use renv in a Github Action, you can put\n\n\n\n\nquarto-publish.yml\n\n- name: Setup Renv\n  uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2\n\n\n\nor use the renv cache code in the yaml section above"

The _freeze file will save a snapshot of that specific document and not re-render it in the Github Action. This means you can render other parts of the website, but any files in the _freeze folder will stay the same as they are in the freeze.
