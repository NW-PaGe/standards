# Access

Our organization has multiple public Github orgs. If you are internal to Washington Department of Health, you will need to submit a Service Central Request for access. Please reach out to frank.aragona@doh.wa.gov for help.

# Github Security

**Please read all of the [security guidelines here](security.qmd)**

The guide will go over

- what data/code is not allowed in a public repo
- security layers you need to prevent leaks
- converting private code to public repositories
- installation of pre-commit hooks to prevent leaks
