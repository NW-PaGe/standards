## [R Github Template](https://github.com/NW-PaGe/R_template)

This is a Github repo template for R projects. It has `renv` set up and a `.devcontainer` for reproducibility


<table>
<tr><td valign="top">

Select `Use Template > NW-PaGe/R_template` when creating a new repo in the NW-PaGe org. The template comes with a pre-filled `README.md` file that you can edit to your own needs. It’s recommended to leave the `.devconainter` folder in this repo. It serves as instructions to install all the software and R packages needed to reproduce the repos code using a Github Codespace. See the `README.md` for more information.

## [Purpledoc Quarto Template](https://github.com/coe-test-org/purpledoc)

This is a Quarto template that contains the style and images used in this site

<table>
<tr><td valign="top">

```
quarto use template coe-test-org/purpledoc
```


This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you
can use as a starting place for your report.

You may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or
document. From the quarto project or document directory, run the
following command to install this format:

```
quarto add coe-test-org/purpledoc
```
