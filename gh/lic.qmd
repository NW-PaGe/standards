There isn't a one size fits all license, so thankfully there are a variety of options. Here are two common ones:

# GNU GPL licenses

a.  These are the strong licenses
b.  Prevents someone from taking our code and privatizing it (and making
    money off of it)
c.  Someone can still use our code, they just need to ensure that what
    they're doing with it is open-source
d.  "Copyright and license notices must be preserved."
e.  "Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. When a
    modified version is used to provide a service over a network, the
    complete source code of the modified version must be made
    available."

# MIT license

a.  I think this is the most commonly used one
b.  "short and simple permissive license... only requiring preservation
    of copyright and license notices"
c.  "Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed
    under different terms and without source code."
d.  Someone could basically do whatever they want with the code.
e.  Nextstain/ncov repo is currently using this

And here are a couple of youtube videos that were helping in explaining
licensing
