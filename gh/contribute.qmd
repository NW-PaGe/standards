{{< bi journals size="3em" >}} **Summary**

- The Northwest Pathogen Genomics Center of Excellence (NW-PaGe) uses a public Github organization to host our code. 
- If you want to contribute to the organization, please read this guide and our [security guidelines](security.qmd).
:::


**You will need Git and Github to make code contributions:**

- Git is a [version control software](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
- Github is a [platform for developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) that utilizes Git
- In order to contribute to this organization you must have Git installed and a Github account


# Git Basics

- You need to install Git on your machine [follow here for help](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
- For a tutorial on how Git works, [follow our Git page here](git.qmd)


# Github Basics

- Go to the [Github website](https://github.com/) to create an account.
- Bookmark the [NW-PaGe Github Org](https://github.com/NW-PaGe)

# Contributing

There are multiple ways to contribute to a Github repo, whether it is to report a bug, request a feature, or actively contribute to the code base.

:::{.panel-tabset}

## Bug Report

To report a bug, 

1. click on a repo and click on the `Issues` tab.

2. click the `New issue` button

3. click on the `Bug Report` tab

From here you will need to fill out the bug report along with steps to reproduce the behavior you're seeing.

## Feature Request

Do you have a feature that you want included in the code base? 

1. click on a repo and click on the `Issues` tab.

2. click the `New issue` button

3. click on the `Feature Request` tab

From here you will need to fill out the feature request along with details

## Discussions

There is a discussions tab in our Github org. You can start discussions, ask questions, and share ideas here.

## Contribute Code

To contribute to a public repo in our Github org, please contact the repo owner to request read/write access. If you want to create a repo in the org, please contact `frank.aragona@doh.wa.gov`.

Before contributing any code, please read our [security policies](security.qmd). There you will find our repo rules and instructions on how to set up pre-commit hooks.

Once granted access, follow the steps below to create a repo and/or collaborate on code.

:::

# Create a Repo {#sec-create-repo}

Once granted access to create a repo, you can go to [our org](https://github.com/orgs/NW-PaGe/) and click `Repositories > New repository` or [click here](https://github.com/organizations/NW-PaGe/repositories/new)

This will take you to the `Create a new repository` screen. Please follow these instructions when filling it out:

:::{.panel-tabset}
### Repository template

Consider using a template unless you want to develop a repo from scratch. We have pre-built R, Python, and base templates that have [Github Codespaces](gh/codespace.qmd) set up as well as `.gitignore` files and virtual environments.

### Owner and Repo name

Make sure the `Owner` name is NW-PaGe. Name your repository something descriptive and easy to type out. Avoid spaces and capital letters unless necessary. 

The repo description can be filled out at any time after creating the repo

### Internal vs Private

We don't allow you to create a public repo initially. Please create a Private repo first, and then once you are ready to make it public you can.

### README, .gitignore, license

- Check the `Add a README file` box.
- Add a `.gitignore` if the option is available (choose either R or Python)
- Choose an `MIT` license unless you know you want a different license [more info here](gh/license.qmd)

:::

# Cloning a Repo {#sec-clone}

Whether you have created your own repo or want to contribute to someone else's repo, you will need to make a local clone of that repo on your personal machine.

To make a local clone of a repo, click on the green `Code` button when you're in the main repo's web page. In the local tab there are multiple ways to clone. For most of our work, I suggest creating an SSH key. If you are new to git/Github and on a Windows machine, I recommend installing the [Github Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) and following the instructions below.

:::{.panel-tabset}

## HTTPS

Cloning via HTTPS is a relatively quick process. 

1. Start by navigating to the repo in Github and selecting the `Code` button:

![](images/https.png)

2. Copy the path that starts with `https://`, in this case it's `https://github.com/NW-PaGe/standards.git`

3. In a terminal/command prompt, navigate to a folder of your choice (in windows I would make a folder called Projects here: `C:/Users/<username>/Projects`)

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
cd C:/Users/<your_username>/Projects
```
:::

4. Use git clone and replace the `https://github.com/NW-PaGe/standards.git` with your path:

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
git clone https://github.com/NW-PaGe/standards.git
```
:::

5. Check if things ran by executing this code:

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
git status
```
:::


**NOTE:** the HTTPS method is good but it will require you to enter your username and a token every time you push a commit to the remote repo in Github. You will need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) whenever you want to make a commit. If this is annoying to you, use the SSH or Github Desktop App methods.

### Make a PAT

Here's a guide on [making a PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)

1. Click on you Github profile icon in the upper right

2. Click Settings

3. Scroll down to `Developer Settings`

4. Select Personal access tokens (classic) and then Generate new token

5. When you make a commit you will need to input this personal access token when it asks for your password. 

**Do not store this token anywhere! Especially make sure it is not stored in your repo. This has tons of security risks and needs to be for singular use only**


## SSH

SSH is an excellent option for cloning a repo. It is similar to using an identifier to tell Github that you are, in fact, you. [This video below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X4u9sca3Io) is a great resource on how to set up the key. I will also write out the steps in the video below. Also, see the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for more information.

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/8X4u9sca3Io?si=bHKQHA28VBz2PXUP >}}

1. In a terminal, write the following and replace the email with your email:

:::{.medframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C your@email.com
```
:::

2. It should then ask if you want to make a passphrase. I recommend doing this

3. Get the pid

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
:::

4. Make a config file

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
touch ~/.ssh/config
```
:::

5. If the file doesn't open, you can open it like this

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
nano ~/.ssh/config
```
:::

6. Add this to the config file. it will use your passkey and recognize you

:::{.medframe}
```{bash filename="ssh/config"}
Host *
  IgnoreUnknown AddKeysToAgent,UseKeychain
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  UseKeychain yes
```
:::

To save this file in nano, on your keyboard write `CRTL+O` then `ENTER` to save the file. Then `CTRL+X` to exit back to the terminal. You can also open this file through a notepad or other software. You could also search for the file in your file explorer and edit it in notepad if that is easier.

7. Add the identity

:::{.medframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
:::

8. In Github, go to your profile and the `SSH + GPG Keys` section

9. Click SSH Keys, add a title, and in the key location write your key. You can find your key in your terminal by writing:

:::{.medframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
:::

**Copy the whole output including your email and paste it into the Github key location**

10. Test it by writing this:

:::{.medframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
ssh -T git@github.com
```
:::

11. Use the key to clone a repo.

Now you can clone a repo using the SSH key. Copy the SSH path and write this (replace the string after clone with your repo of choice):

:::{.medframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
git clone git@github.com:org/reponame.git
```
:::


## GitHub CLI

The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) is an excellent tool for not just cloning your repo, but for managing repositories and organizations from a terminal. 

:::{.panel-tabset}

### Windows

To install the CLI in Windos, I follwed the instructions provided in the [Github CLI repo](https://github.com/cli/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#windows).

I normally install commands using Scoop, but you have many options here.

1. Paste this code into a powershell window and execute it

:::{.smallframe}


```{bash filename="powershell"}
winget install --id GitHub.cli

```

:::

2. Now update the package

:::{.smallframe}

```{bash}
winget upgrade --id GitHub.cli
```

:::

3. You will need to authorize your github account like this:

:::{.smallframe}

```{bash}
gh auth login
```

:::

4. It will ask you to authorize in a browser or with a personal access token

  I created a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

5. Now you can clone a repo like this:

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
gh repo clone org/repo-name
```
:::

You can also now do some cool things with your org/repo like searching for strings, creating issues, and more. For example, here are the issues in this repo:

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
gh issue list
```
:::

```{markdown filename="output"}

#3  Make sure all references are added to ...  documentation  about 5 months ago
#2  Fix cross reference links                  documentation  about 5 months ago
```



### WSL/Linux

To install in a linux terminal, I'm following the instructions provided in the [Github CLI repo](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md).

1. Paste this code into your bash terminal and execute it.

```{bash filename="terminal"}
(type -p wget >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install wget -y)) \
&& sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings \
&& wget -qO- https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null \
&& sudo chmod go+r /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
&& echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
&& sudo apt update \
&& sudo apt install gh -y
```

2. Then upgrate the command with the code below

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```
:::

3. You now need to authorize yourself as a user. 

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
gh auth login
```
:::

4. It will ask you to authorize in a browser or with a personal access token

  I created a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens). In linux there are some issues with the command and using a browser fyi.

5. Now you can clone a repo like this:

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
gh repo clone org/repo-name
```
:::

You can also now do some cool things with your org/repo like searching for strings, creating issues, and more. For example, here are the issues in this repo:

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
gh issue list
```
:::

```{markdown filename="output"}
Showing 3 of 3 open issues in NW-PaGe/standards

ID  TITLE                                      LABELS         UPDATED           
#7  add .gitignore documentation                              about 2 months ago
#3  Make sure all references are added to ...  documentation  about 5 months ago
#2  Fix cross reference links                  documentation  about 5 months ago
```

## Open with GitHub Desktop

If you're new to Git or Github and are using a Windows machine, the GitHub Desktop app is a great option for managing git workflows. 

1. Install the [app](https://desktop.github.com/)

2. You will need to [authenticate](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github-in-github-desktop) your account 

3. Now you should be able to clone repos through the app. In Github, when you click on the Code tab you will see the option to open in Github Desktop:

![](images/gh-desktop.png)

This will open up the desktop app and let you choose a file path for your Github repos. I recommend putting your repos into a Github or Projects folder in your local C drive, like this 

- `C:/Users/yourname/Projects/<your-repo>/` 

If you're cloning many repos you should put the repos into folders separated by the Github org 

- `C:/Users/yourname/Projects/<gh-org-name>/<repo-in-org>/`

# Code Collaboration

Code collaboration can vary widely depending on the team and owner of the repo. Below I will describe how our team collaborates in Github. To summarize, in our system we prioritize preserving the main branch of a repo for production level code, and when we want to make changes we do it locally in a separate branch. We have rules for our commit messages, making pull requests (merging changes into the main branch), taging issues, release cycles, and documenting changes. 

:::{.panel-tabset}

## Before you make code changes
After [creating a repo](#sec-create-repo) and/or [cloning the repo](#sec-clone) into a your local machine, you can start writing and contributing code to the remote code base in Github.

1. Check that you have your local clone linked to the remote repo by running git status. It should tell you that you're on the main branch

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
git status
```
:::

2. We need to refresh the repo and check for any code changes to make sure our local clone is up to date. Use `git fetch` to find changes and `git pull` to pull those changes into your local clone.

:::{.smallframe}

```{bash filename="terminal"}
git fetch
git pull
```
:::

3. Make a new branch so we can isolate your changes and prevent accidentally pushing code changes to the main branch

:::{.smallframe}

```{bash filename="terminal"}
git branch <insert your branch name here>
```
:::

4. Switch to that branch

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
git switch <your branch name here>
```
:::

Now you are working in the local branch that you created and you can begin writing code or making updates.

## Committing your changes

Once you make changes you can commit them to the local branch you created. This is like saving your work to the branch. The branch can be pushed to the remote repo in Github, so you can continually make changes and push them to the remote where they will be stored safely.

To make a commit, save your work and then in the terminal write `git commit -m "<your message here"`, like this:

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
git commit -m "feat: this is a new feature!"
```
:::

Note that the `-m` is a parameter to let you write a commit message. Commit messages are important so that other collaborators can understand what changes you made. You can write a description like this 

:::{.smallframe}
```{bash filename="terminal"}
git commit -m "feat: this is a new feature!" "this is a description. I made this feature in the code"
```
:::

Also note that I am using the word `feat` in the commit message. This is important word that can trigger a github action. We'll cover it below in [the Release Cycles and Changelogs section](#sec-changelog)

## Make a pull request

Now you have committed your changes, but your code has only been committed to a _branch_. In order to have your changes implemented in the main codebase you need to merge your branch into the main branch. 

When working in a collaborative team setting it is important to have your team review the changes you made before implementing them into the main branch. Everyone makes mistakes, and this is an opportunity to vet your code and have everyone sign off on the changes you want.

After you make your commits, go back to Github in your browser and go to your repo. There should be a box that appears showing your commit and a button that says `Compare & pull request`

![](images/pull.png)

Click that button and it will bring you to the `Open a pull request` page.

1. Select who you want to review your code and assign yourself.
2. Use labels to tag what this pull request refers to (very helpful in search for changes when managing the project) and
3. Add a milestone if it applies.

Note that labels, milestones, and projects are a way to keep track of changes and issues in your project. I highly recommend setting them up, more below.

This should automatically send an email to the reviewers that there is code needed to be merged to a branch.

![](images/gitdesk2333-01.gif)

## Merging a branch to main {#sec-merge}

Typically your teammates and the repo admin will review your code and merge your branch into the main branch.

In Github, click on the `Pull requests` tab. Here you will see open pull requests and you can click on the one you want to merge.

![Review a pull request](images/review.png)

<br>

In the pull request you will see 4 tabs; 

1. Conversation tab that shows all the comments, descriptions, tags, and more.
2. Commits tab that contains a list of all the commits made in this request
3. Checks - if you have automated testing or apps in the repo you can trigger them with a pull request and see them here. For example, you can set up automated unit tests to run whenever a pull request is made. A github action will run the unit test and pass (or fail) here before it is merged to main.
4. Files changed - I personally always flip through this tab because it shows all the differences (diffs) between the old codebase and the new commits that were made.

![Files Changed](images/files_changed.png)

<br>

When you are comfortable with merging these changes, you can either leave a comment, approve, or request further changes by clicking on the `Review changes` dropdown menu.

![Review changes](images/lgtm.png)


<br>

You can leave inline comments in the commits by viewing the file of choice, and then hovering over the line of interest and clicking the `+` sign:

![view file](images/comment.png)

![inline comment](images/inline_comment.png)

These comments will be tagged in the pull request and will need to be resolved by the person making the request before the code can get merged into the main branch.


<br>

Once the pull request has the approvals needed, you can merge it. Note, admins can customize how approvals work. We normally just have one admin or person required to approve a pull request for it to be mergeable. To state again, in the `Review changes` dropdown there is an option to approve the request - that is what is required.

![merge](images/merge.png)

After approval, hopefully you have a message that says _This branch has no conflicts with the base branch_. If there are conflicts it will prevent you from merging. We require the user who made the commit to resolve merge conflicts. The conflict typically happens when your branch is out of date and it is not lined up with the current main branch. You sometimes need to merge the main branch into your local branch and then commit those changes. This is very scenario dependent and requires some googling. Please reach out to us for help if this happens!

## Release Cycles and Changelogs {#sec-changelog}

As I mentioned before, I used special trigger words like `feat` or `fix` in commit messages. These words indicate that a commit contains a new code feature or a bug fix. They trigger a github action that will produce a changelog, documentation, and a version change in the code based when the branch gets merged to main. Please read more about this topic in [release cycles](release.qmd). In summary, there are key words you can add to your commit message that will trigger certain actions. 

For example, the word `bug` will trigger the version _patch_ number to increase, meaning if your current codebase is on version v1.0.0 it will increase the version to v1.0.1 . Here's what it looks like in Github:

::: {.column-screen-inset-shaded layout-nrow="1"}
![](images/fix.PNG){.myframe}

![](images/fix2.PNG){.myframe}
:::

<br>

The word `feat` will trigger a change in the minor version, so it will bump v1.0.0 to v1.1.0. There are many other words that can trigger actions and you can customize them to do what you want.

I strongly recommend implementing this in your repo and working in a release cycle. To give an example, our team has a 1 month release cycle:

- week 1: planning out code changes and fixes
- week 2: writing out code and making pull requests
- week 3: reviewing pull requests and testing them
- week 4: preparing communications about the new changes and merging the code to main

Once the code is merged to main, we have a [github action](https://nw-page.github.io/standards/gh/release.html#step-by-step-instructions) that automatically creates our versioning, change logs, documentation, and saves a snapshot of our codebase. The action looks for trigger words (like `fix`, `feat` or `BREAKING CHANGE`) and it will divide the commits that were merged into the main branch and write out all the documentation for the change log. It looks like this:

![](images/releases_nav2.gif)

<br>

Notice that I can:

- Use the version numbers as a tag and switch versions of my entire code base. Very useful if something breaks in production and you want to revert to the old code base, and it gives someone the option of downloading a specific version of your package
- I have a summary of all the commits (with links) that were included in that version
- I don't need to manually do anything
- I can send that change log to leadership and show a high level view of the changes made, with the option to see granular details if wanted
- It documents all of you conversations and changes (+1 for transparency! ➕)

For more details, follow the [release cycles guide](release.qmd)
