Using local environment files along with `.gitignore` can prevent credentials from being accidentally pushed into your repo. Other guardrails like **pre-commit hooks** can be used to further prevent accidental credential leaks.

[Licensing details here](std/lic.qmd)\n\n{{< fa book >}} This organization requires each repo to have [certain documents](std/templates.qmd), such as a CODE_OF_CONDUCT. The organization uses a special repo called **.github** to ensure all repos adhere to the policies and have the right documents.\n\n\n{{< fa note-sticky >}} If you're looking to build a repository, [check out the Github user guide tabs](tools/how_to.qmd) for best practices on reproducibility, documentation in the repo, and more.\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<!--\n\n![](images/DOH_logo_primary.jpg){style=\"float: center;\" fig-alt=\"Hex logo that says \\\"Data Science in a Box\\\"\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"250\"}\n\nDocumentation for how to structure and standardize the public Github Organization\n# Preface {.unnumbered}\n\n![](images/DOH_logo_primary.jpg){style=\"float: right;\" fig-alt=\"Hex logo that says \\\"Data Science in a Box\\\"\" fig-align=\"right\" width=\"250\"}\n\nThis is a static website documenting the proposed standards for public Github use at the Pacific Northwest Genomic Center of Excellence.
