## Quickstart

This is a static website documenting the proposed policies and standards for public Github use at the Pacific Northwest Genomic Center of Excellence. There are documents on

1.  Security and how to protect credential and private process leaks {{< fa unlock >}}
2.  Licensing to protect against re-sale or theft of code {{< fa file >}}
3.  Our Github rules, policies, and templates {{< fa book >}}
4.  Github user guides {{< fa file >}}

If there are any questions please reach out to


::: {.column-screen-inset-shaded layout-nrow="1"}
{{< fa unlock >}} **Personal or network credentials, tokens, server names and more are prohibited from being published to our public repos.** Protect security and credentials with good coding practices. Using local environment files along with `.gitignore` can prevent credentials from being accidentally pushed into your repo. Other guardrails like **pre-commit hooks** can be used to further prevent accidental credential leaks. [**See more details on our security policies here**](std/security.qmd)

```{yaml filename="local_credentials.yml"}
# local yaml file that will NOT be pushed to the repo
# add this file to the .gitignore to prevent leaks
my_credentials:
  username: super_secret_user_name
  password: 12345terriblepassword
  
  
  
  
```

```{r filename="script_in_repo.R"}
# this script is in the repo, but credentials are hidden
library(yaml)

# read in the local credentials yaml file
creds <- yaml::read_yaml("path/to/local_credentials.yml")

# pull in the credentials
username <- creds$my_credentials$username
password <- creds$my_credentials$password
```

::: {.column-screen-inset-shaded layout-nrow="1"}
{{< fa file >}} Each repo in the organization should have a license. Licenses can help prevent your work from being stolen and/or used inappropriately. [Licensing details here](std/lic.qmd)

{{< fa book >}} This organization requires each repo to have [certain documents](std/templates.qmd), such as a CODE_OF_CONDUCT. The organization uses a special repo called **.github** to ensure all repos adhere to the policies and have the right documents.

{{< fa file >}} If you're looking to build a repository, [check out the Github user guide tabs](tools/how_to.qmd) for best practices on reproducibility, documentation in the repo, and more.
